# Emotions Identification KNN Classifier 


This repository presents the development of a basic algorithm for emotion recognition based on a neural network model with KNN classifier trained with the FER-2013 database. (https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013)

The repository consists of a NN_Training.py file that runs the training of the classifier model and exports it to a .sav file. 
The Clas_Emotions.py executable loads the KNN classifier model (TrainedModel.sav) and uses it to perform the classification of emotions through the webcam of the computer used.  


This work is presented for the Sheel Eco-Marathon Pitch the Future 2022's Competition with the Universidad Nacional de Colombia's student Group STEOS (Sistemas de Tracción Eléctricos Optimos y Sostenibles)
